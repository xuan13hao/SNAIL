# 🐌 SNAIL_XGBoost

**SNAIL** (Software NAme Identification from Literature) is a high-performance tool designed to identify software and database mentions (dbsoft) in biomedical literature.  
It combines rule-based linguistic features, pattern matching, and a fine-tuned XGBoost model to achieve robust classification—even under extreme class imbalance.
